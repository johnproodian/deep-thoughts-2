# Deep Thoughts
A social media application where users can sign up, create an account, post their thoughts, and interact with other users.

## Note
My contribution to this project (in terms of code added to the app's codebase in this repo) is restricted to the front end. I did type up the back end, and some of the front end code, before I walked away from it, leaving that code in [this repo](https://github.com/johnproodian/deep-thoughts).

When I returned to the project, however, I wanted to start the front-end portion of the project from scratch, and so (instead of using ```git revert```, like I should have) I created a new repo (this one), seeded it with a "snapshot" (provided by the tutorial I was following) of code at the end of the back end section (right before the front end section started) and continued on from there. 

So, "my" code for this project is in two places. My apologies.

## Built With
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* React
* Apollo Server
* Express.js
* NoSQL/MySQL
* Mongoose
* GraphQL

## What I Learned
* Differences between GraphQL and RESTful APIs
* Configuring a proxy server for local development of a MERN application
* Implementing client-side routing using React Router
* Building API endpoints with GraphQL in a MERN application
* Configuring and deploying a MERN application to Heroku
* Implementing authetication with JWT
