# Deep Thoughts
testing testing one more time and again

## Note

My contribution to this project (in terms of code added to the app's codebase in this repo) is restricted to the front end. I did type up the back end, and some of the front end code, before I walked away from it, leaving that code in [this repo](https://github.com/johnproodian/deep-thoughts).

I wanted to start the front-end portion of the project from scratch, however, and so (instead of using ```git revert```, like I should have) I created a new repo (this one), seeded it with a "snapshot" (provided by the tutorial I was following) of code at the end of the back end section, right before the front end section started, and went from there. 

So, my code for this project is in two places. My apologies.
